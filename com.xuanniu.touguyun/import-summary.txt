ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => push/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* libs/arm64-v8a/libjpush181.so => push/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libjpush181.so
* libs/armeabi-v7a/libjpush181.so => push/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi-v7a/libjpush181.so
* libs/armeabi/libjpush181.so => push/src/main/jniLibs/armeabi/libjpush181.so
* libs/jpush-sdk-release1.8.1.jar => push/libs/jpush-sdk-release1.8.1.jar
* proguard-project.txt => push/proguard-project.txt
* res/ => push/src/main/res/
* src/ => push/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
